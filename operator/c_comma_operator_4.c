// in this program ,(comma) operator is act like a seprator because
// int var1 = 1,3,4 is equivalent to int var1 = 1; int 3; int 8;
// we know that we can not declare variable starting with digit
// thus this program generate error 
// NOTE :- comma(,) operator is treated as seprator when we use within function call and definition and variable declaration , enum declaration
